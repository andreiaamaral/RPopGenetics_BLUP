Dates: 27-30 May 2024
Venue: University of Évora

# Objectives of the course:
 
This course aims to provide a concise introduction to conducting applied analyses of population genetic data in R with special emphasis in populations of domestic animals and of species under conservation programs. R provides a tool with its packages that allows analyses of most data conveniently and on all major platforms Microsoft windows, Linux, and Apples’s OS X. R is an open-source statistical programming and graphing language that includes tools for statistical, population genetics, genomics, phylogenetics, and comparative genomic analyses. Participants are expected to have a basic understanding of population genetic theory and applications. Finally, this course will be based on traditional population genetics based on allele frequencies establishing the foundations for the development and application of genetic selection.


## Overview of the program:

1- Introduction to R: An introduction to the installation and usage of R and of Rstudio will be provided.

2- Basic concepts of population genetic theory and applications. Laws of Mendel, Wright Fisher Model, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Basic metrics in population genetics.

3- Introduction to animal breeding. Heritability, transmission model, estimation of breeding value in simple cases (single phenotype). Estimating breeding values with multiple sources of information (selection index).

4- Application of Best Linear Unbiased Predictor methodology for the evaluation of the genetic merit of domestic animals. Discussion of the application in companion animals and wild threatened populations. Case Studies: application to local breeds. Discussion focusing in Portuguese Local breeds and populations. 

## Teachers: Niccoló Macciota (NM),  University of Sassari and Andreia J. Amaral (AJA), University of Évora

NM is full professor of animal breeding at the Department of Agricultural Science of the University of Sassari. He gives courses in animal breeding and in statistics for graduated students, and in statistics for PhD students. He is the chair of the Teaching Committee of the Department. He is the president of the Italian Association for Animal Science and Production (ASPA). He is member of the technical commission of the Italian Simmental cattle breed and of the In 2006, he has been visiting professor at the Centre of Genetic Improvement of Livestock of the Department of Animal and Poultry Science of Guelph University (Canada) . He is author or co-
author of more than 120 articles published in international scientific Journals ranked on Scopus.

- The study of genetic evaluation models and selection schemes for the improvement of milk production..
- The development of models for genomic selection
- The study of genetic diversity of species of local breeds using both traditional methods and genomic analysis.
- The use of innovative phenotypes in the genetic improvement of species of livestock interest. IHe has been section editor for breeding, genetics and genomics of Journal of Dairy Science

AJA  is an assistant professor at University of Évora of animal breeding and genetics providing education to the MSc of Veterinarian Medicine and of Zootechnical Engineering.  AJA currently leads a line of research entitled “Molecular Mechanisms Associated with Host/Pathogen Adaptation” in which she applies an approach of integrative genetics. Since her PhD at Wageningen University in the Netherlands (Genetics 2008;179(1):569-79; and PLoS ONE 6(4): e14782), where she pioneered the first studies using WGS to study genome architecture and selection.  AJA continued a path aiming to understand the basis of genetics architecture, and its link to the phenome working in the biomedicine field (EMBO J 2017; 36(3): 346-360). AJA has made contributions to the development of software to analyse small-RNA-seq data (BMC Bioinformatics 22, 37 (2021)). She lead BOVREG(H2020) in Portugal which contributed largely to the development of open-source software development for the analyses of animal genome (BOVREG, PAG 2020). Currently she leads PT-GeroNIMO (H2020), AngFarmBiodiv(Front Genet. 2022 Oct 24;13:1003069) and ResisTrypSheep. These studies focus on the effect of epigenetics in the phenome and adaptation.
